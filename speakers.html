                        <hr><p class="speaker-desc">
                            Sir David Klenerman FRS FMedSci is a British biophysical chemist and a professor of biophysical chemistry at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge. He has developed and applied new methods such as fluorescence spectroscopy to biological and biomedical problems. His group is now focusing on super-resolution microscopy to find out more about  protein misfolding and neurodegenerative diseases.
<br><br>
He is one of the co-inventors (with Prof Shankar Balasubramanian) of the leading next-generation sequencing methodology, Solexa-Illumina sequencing. The method is based on solid phase enzymatic sequencing of vast numbers of DNA molecules on a surface in parallel, using novel fluorophore-coded nucleotides, to make a highly miniaturised, cheap and fast DNA sequencer. This allows rapid sequencing of the 3 billion bases in a  human genome for less than $1000 a day. Solexa-Illumina sequencing is widely used in both basic biological and biomedical research. It is also starting to be routinely used as part of medical treatments including non-invasive prenatal testing, cancer detection and treatment and the diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic diseases, particularly for children. 
<br><br>
For his work, Sir David has received numerous accolades, including being knighted by the Queen in 2019, for the development of high-speed DNA sequencing, and being awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 2018. Together with Shankar Balasubramanian, he was awarded the 2020 Millenium Technology Prize. Most recently, he has also been awarded the 2022 Breakthrough Prize for Life Sciences jointly with Shankar Balasubramanian and Pascal Mayer for next-generation sequencing.

                            Sir David MacMillan was born in 1968 and raised in the Scottish town of New Stevenston. He is currently the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry at Princeton University. In 2021, he shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry with Professor Benjamin List for their research into organocatalysis. 
                            <br><br>
Sir David MacMillan obtained an undergraduate degree in Chemistry from the University of Glasgow in 1990, before moving to the United States to pursue his doctoral studies in organic synthesis at the University of California, Irvine. Sir David McMillan eventually became an individual researcher and joined the department of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology in 2000 as the Earle C. Anthony Chair of Organic Chemistry. 
<br><br>
Sir David MacMillan had a keen interest in the use of small organic molecules as a more environmentally friendly method of synthesizing organic compounds commonly used in fields such as pharmaceutical research. During his initial years of research at the California Institute of Technology, Sir David MacMillan's idea was often dismissed by his peers. However, he believed in the use of effective communication as a means of convincing his peers of his ideas. In his opinion, science is not merely the experiments that happen in the laboratory, but also the communication of one's findings and achievements. 
<br><br>
Sir David MacMillan's resilience paid off when he received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2021 for his research in this field. The prize money was generously donated to the May and Billy MacMillan Foundation, which he founded to provide educational opportunities to underprivileged students in Scotland.

                        <hr><p class="speaker-desc">
                            Sir Tim Hunt was born in 1943 in Neston, the United Kingdom. He was awarded the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Sir Paul Nurse and Dr Leland H. Hartwell for their discovery of the key regulators of the cell cycle. Sir Tim's contribution was the discovery of cyclins, which are proteins involved in cell cycle regulation.
<br><br>
Sir Tim developed an interest in biology at a young age. From 1961 to 1964, Sir Tim read Natural Sciences at Cambridge, before proceeding to complete his Ph.D. entitled “The Synthesis of Haemoglobin” in 1968 at the Department of Biochemistry at Cambridge. 
<br><br>
Sir Tim's important discovery of cyclins was made in the 1980s while he was studying protein synthesis in sea urchins and clam eggs. As an avid cyclist, he named the protein after the cyclical changes in its levels during the cell cycle. The study of the relationship between the cell cycle and diseases such as cancer continues to be the focus of many scientists. Blocking specific cyclins could inhibit cancer cell divisions.  In 1990, Sir Tim continued his research at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (later known as the Cancer Research UK), where he explored the field of cancer cells.
<br><br>
Apart from being awarded a Nobel Prize, Sir Tim was knighted and received the Royal Medal from the Royal Society of London in 2006.

                            Prof Alison Woollard first received her undergraduate degree in London and graduated with First Class Honours in Biological Sciences in 1991. She then obtained her PhD in Oxford in 1995. She also moved to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge in 1995. Following her Medical Research Council fellowship in Cambridge, Prof Alison Woollard returned to Oxford in 2000 to take up her fellowship at Hertford College and subsequently, a University Lecturership in the Biochemistry Department.
                            <br><br>
Prof Alison Woollard currently leads a research team working on the developmental genetics of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Her work mainly concerns molecular mechanisms of cell fate determination and morphogenesis during C. elegans development. This involves the unravelling of complex mechanisms by which cells become different from one another as an organism develops from egg to adult. 
<br><br>
For her outstanding career, Prof Alison Woollard was awarded the 2015 Genetics Society JBS Haldane Lectureship. The award served to recognise her public engagement activities. Her BBC Radio 4 “Life Scientific” was broadcast in spring 2017 and she is involved in a diverse range of  public engagement activities  from pop festivals to stand-up comedy.

                            Prof Hartmut Michel is a German biochemist, who received the 1988 Nobel Prize in Chemistry jointly with Johann Deisenhofer and Robert Huber, for discovering the first crystal structure of membrane-bound protein active in photosynthesis. 
<br><br>
Prof Michel worked with Deisenhofer and Huber to determine the three-dimensional structure of a photosynthetic reaction centre, found in certain photosynthetic bacteria, which was integral in initiating a type of photosynthesis. Their research shed more light on the mechanisms of photosynthesis, showcased similarities between the photosynthetic processes of plants and bacteria and established a methodology for crystallising membrane proteins. Prof Michel's interest then pivoted to the workings of the respiratory system, in particular terminal oxidases. His team has also conducted research on secondary active transporters like the sodium ion, the members of the drug-resistance causing transporter of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family, and various amino acid transporters from humans.
<br><br>
In 1986, Prof Michel received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. In 1987, he became a department head and director at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt am Main. Besides the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Prof Michel has received numerous other awards in recognition of his outstanding achievements in science. For example, in 2008, the British Biochemical Society honoured him with the Keilin Medal.
