                        <p class="speaker-desc">
                            Sir David Klenerman FRS FMedSci is a British biophysical chemist and a professor of
                            biophysical chemistry at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge and a
                            Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge. He has developed and applied new methods such as
                            fluorescence spectroscopy to biological and biomedical problems. His group is now focusing
                            on super-resolution microscopy to find out more about protein misfolding and
                            neurodegenerative diseases.
                            <br><br>
                            He is one of the co-inventors (with Prof Shankar Balasubramanian) of the leading
                            next-generation sequencing methodology, Solexa-Illumina sequencing. The method is based on
                            solid phase enzymatic sequencing of vast numbers of DNA molecules on a surface in parallel,
                            using novel fluorophore-coded nucleotides, to make a highly miniaturised, cheap and fast DNA
                            sequencer. This allows rapid sequencing of the 3 billion bases in a human genome for less
                            than $1000 a day. Solexa-Illumina sequencing is widely used in both basic biological and
                            biomedical research. It is also starting to be routinely used as part of medical treatments
                            including non-invasive prenatal testing, cancer detection and treatment and the diagnosis
                            and treatment of rare genetic diseases, particularly for children.
                            <br><br>
                            For his work, Sir David has received numerous accolades, including being knighted by the
                            Queen in 2019, for the development of high-speed DNA sequencing, and being awarded the Royal
                            Society's Royal Medal in 2018. Together with Shankar Balasubramanian, he was awarded the
                            2020 Millenium Technology Prize. Most recently, he has also been awarded the 2022
                            Breakthrough Prize for Life Sciences jointly with Shankar Balasubramanian and Pascal Mayer
                            for next-generation sequencing.

                            Sir David MacMillan was born in 1968 and raised in the Scottish town of New Stevenston. He
                            is currently the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry at
                            Princeton University. In 2021, he shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry with Professor
                            Benjamin List for their research into organocatalysis.
                            <br><br>
                            Sir David MacMillan obtained an undergraduate degree in Chemistry from the University of
                            Glasgow in 1990, before moving to the United States to pursue his doctoral studies in
                            organic synthesis at the University of California, Irvine. Sir David McMillan eventually
                            became an individual researcher and joined the department of chemistry at the California
                            Institute of Technology in 2000 as the Earle C. Anthony Chair of Organic Chemistry.
                            <br><br>
                            Sir David MacMillan had a keen interest in the use of small organic molecules as a more
                            environmentally friendly method of synthesizing organic compounds commonly used in fields
                            such as pharmaceutical research. During his initial years of research at the California
                            Institute of Technology, Sir David MacMillan's idea was often dismissed by his peers.
                            However, he believed in the use of effective communication as a means of convincing his
                            peers of his ideas. In his opinion, science is not merely the experiments that happen in the
                            laboratory, but also the communication of one's findings and achievements.
                            <br><br>
                            Sir David MacMillan's resilience paid off when he received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in
                            2021 for his research in this field. The prize money was generously donated to the May and

                            Sir Tim Hunt was born in 1943 in Neston, the United Kingdom. He was awarded the 2001 Nobel
                            Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Sir Paul Nurse and Dr Leland H. Hartwell for
                            their discovery of the key regulators of the cell cycle. Sir Tim's contribution was the
                            discovery of cyclins, which are proteins involved in cell cycle regulation.
                            <br><br>
                            Sir Tim developed an interest in biology at a young age. From 1961 to 1964, Sir Tim read
                            Natural Sciences at Cambridge, before proceeding to complete his Ph.D. entitled "The
                            Synthesis of Haemoglobin" in 1968 at the Department of Biochemistry at Cambridge.
                            <br><br>
                            Sir Tim's important discovery of cyclins was made in the 1980s while he was studying protein
                            synthesis in sea urchins and clam eggs. As an avid cyclist, he named the protein after the
                            cyclical changes in its levels during the cell cycle. The study of the relationship between
                            the cell cycle and diseases such as cancer continues to be the focus of many scientists.
                            Blocking specific cyclins could inhibit cancer cell divisions. In 1990, Sir Tim continued
                            his research at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (later known as the Cancer Research UK),
                            where he explored the field of cancer cells.

                            Apart from being awarded a Nobel Prize, Sir Tim was knighted and received the Royal Medal
                            from the Royal Society of London in 2006.

                            Prof Hartmut Michel is a German biochemist, who received the 1988 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
                            jointly with Johann Deisenhofer and Robert Huber, for discovering the first crystal
                            structure of membrane-bound protein active in photosynthesis.
                            <br><br>
                            Prof Michel worked with Deisenhofer and Huber to determine the three-dimensional structure
                            of a photosynthetic reaction centre, found in certain photosynthetic bacteria, which was
                            integral in initiating a type of photosynthesis. Their research shed more light on the
                            mechanisms of photosynthesis, showcased similarities between the photosynthetic processes of
                            plants and bacteria and established a methodology for crystallising membrane proteins. Prof
                            Michel's interest then pivoted to the workings of the respiratory system, in particular
                            terminal oxidases. His team has also conducted research on secondary active transporters
                            like the sodium ion, the members of the drug-resistance causing transporter of the multidrug
                            and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family, and various amino acid transporters from humans.

                            In 1986, Prof Michel received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche
                            Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. In 1987, he
                            became a department head and director at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt
                            am Main. Besides the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Prof Michel has received numerous other
                            awards in recognition of his outstanding achievements in science. For example, in 2008, the
                            British Biochemical Society honoured him with the Keilin Medal.
